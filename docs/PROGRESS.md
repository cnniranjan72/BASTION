# BASTION — Progress Log

## Status: Phase 1 complete
Phase: 1 (event core + interceptor) → next up: Phase 2 (policy engine, DSL + hot reload)

## Log
- [2026-08-14] Project specced out (PRD, ARCHITECTURE, DATA_MODEL, AUTH, API_SPEC, BUILD_PLAN written). No code yet.
- [2026-08-14] Phase 0 complete:
  - Repo initialized (`git init`), directory layout per BUILD_PLAN.md: `interceptor/`, `aggregator/`,
    `frontend/` (placeholder only), `sdk-python/`, `shared/`, `infra/`, `docs/`.
  - **Language pivot**: started Phase 0 on Node/TypeScript (Fastify) for interceptor+aggregator with a
    Zod `shared` package, then switched to **Python + FastAPI** at the user's request before any real
    logic existed (only health-check skeletons) — cheap to redo, so did the full rework rather than a
    partial one. Reasoning recorded in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §7: one language across the whole
    non-UI backend (SDK, interceptor, aggregator, and the Phase 8 demo agent are all Python), and
    FastAPI's auto-generated OpenAPI schema gives Phase 11's "flag API_SPEC.md drift" deliverable a
    concrete artifact instead of a hand-written comparison.
  - `shared/` is now `bastion_shared`, a Pydantic package that `interceptor`, `aggregator`, and
    `sdk-python` import directly (not codegen) — events, policy DSL, `/intercept` request/response,
    error envelope, and `/live` WS messages all modeled, mirroring DATA_MODEL.md and API_SPEC.md
    field-for-field.
  - `interceptor` and `aggregator`: FastAPI skeletons with `/healthz`, structured logging
    (`structlog`), and a `request_id` middleware per CLAUDE.md rule #2.
  - Python monorepo tooling: `uv` workspace, `ruff`+`mypy --strict` clean, `pytest`.
  - Docker Compose: Postgres 16 + Redis 7, both healthy. **Postgres on host port 5442, not 5432**
    (collision with another local project) — documented in ARCHITECTURE.md §7.
  - CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): `uv sync` → `ruff check` → `ruff format --check` → `mypy` →
    `pytest`, against live Postgres+Redis service containers. Not yet pushed/run on GitHub.
  - No "Warden" references found anywhere in `docs/`.
- [2026-08-14] **Credentials provisioned for Phase 9 (deployment), ahead of schedule**: user supplied
  a Neon Postgres connection string and a Render API key mid-Phase-1. Both verified working (Neon:
  live `SELECT version()`; Render: `render workspace current`). Stored only in the gitignored root
  `.env` (never committed, never printed after initial verification); `.env.example` documents the
  variable names with no real values. **Decision, confirmed with user**: local dev and the test suite
  keep using Docker Compose Postgres, not Neon — Neon is reserved for the actual deployed environment
  in Phase 9. Recorded in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §7.
- [2026-08-14] Phase 1 complete:
  - Migration runner (`infra/db/migrate.py`, no ORM/Alembic — numbered `.sql` files in
    `infra/db/migrations/`, tracked in a `schema_migrations` table). `0001_init.sql` creates
    `organizations`, `agents` (FK to `policies` deferred to Phase 2 — table doesn't exist yet), and
    `events` with the two indexes DATA_MODEL.md calls for.
  - **Append-only enforcement**: `BEFORE UPDATE/DELETE` triggers on `events` that unconditionally
    `RAISE EXCEPTION`. Verified by hand against live Postgres: `UPDATE`/`DELETE` both rejected; as a
    side effect, deleting the test agent/org also correctly fails once it has events (FK + immutable
    events means the row genuinely cannot be un-created).
  - **Per-trace sequence numbers under concurrency**: `bastion_next_sequence_number(trace_id)` Postgres
    function using a transaction-scoped advisory lock (`pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtextextended(...))`)
    so same-trace inserts serialize while different-trace inserts never contend. Backstopped by a
    `UNIQUE (trace_id, sequence_number)` constraint. Full reasoning in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §9.
  - **Spec deviation, flagged and resolved**: ARCHITECTURE.md §2.2 describes the interceptor itself
    executing the real downstream call when a call is allowed, but neither `InterceptRequest` nor
    DATA_MODEL.md gives it anything to reach a downstream system with. Decision: the interceptor
    decides + logs only; the SDK executes the real call locally (only ever invoking it on `allowed`,
    which is the actual mechanism that prevents a blocked call from running) and reports the outcome
    via a new `POST /spans/{span_id}/complete` endpoint. Documented in `API_SPEC.md` and
    `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §8, not silently implemented.
  - `POST /intercept`: Bearer agent-API-key auth (SHA-256 lookup hash per AUTH.md §1),
    request-body `agent_id` must match the authenticated agent (`AGENT_MISMATCH`, 403) — the key
    determines identity, the body field is a stated-identity check. Hardcoded policy
    (`interceptor/src/bastion_interceptor/policy.py`): blocks `DELETE` queries against the
    `production` database, allows everything else. Emits `CallAttempted` → `CallAllowed`/`CallBlocked`.
  - `POST /spans/{span_id}/complete`: only valid for a span `/intercept` most recently allowed;
    emits `CallCompleted`/`CallFailed`.
  - Real Python SDK (`sdk-python/bastion/`): `BastionClient.call(tool_name, args, execute)` — `execute`
    is only invoked on `allowed`. Trace/span context propagated via a `contextvar`
    (`bastion/context.py`), so nested `call()`s inside an `execute` callback automatically inherit the
    right parent, and `asyncio.gather`'d concurrent children each get an independent context copy —
    no manual trace_id/span_id threading required by calling code.
  - **Milestone test passes**
    (`interceptor/tests/test_causal_ordering.py::test_concurrent_nested_calls_reconstruct_causal_graph`):
    real SDK, real FastAPI app (via `httpx.ASGITransport`, not mocked), real Postgres. Root call fans
    out 8 concurrent children, each with its own concurrent grandchild (17 spans total). Asserts:
    zero gaps/duplicates in `sequence_number` under concurrent writers on one trace, correct
    parent/child span reconstruction from `parent_span_id`, and correct per-span sub-event ordering
    (`CallAttempted` → `CallAllowed` → `CallCompleted`). All 4 interceptor tests + full 11-test
    workspace suite pass; `ruff`/`mypy --strict` clean.
  - Fixed along the way: pytest-asyncio defaults to a fresh event loop per test function, which broke
    the session-scoped asyncpg pool ("attached to a different loop"). Fixed via
    `asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope = "session"` / `asyncio_default_test_loop_scope = "session"`
    — had to be set in **each package's own** `pyproject.toml`, not just the root one, since pytest
    uses the nearest ini file found, not a merge of all of them up the tree.

## Next up
- Phase 2: policy YAML DSL + compiler (replacing the hardcoded rule), Redis pub/sub hot-reload to
  interceptor instances, policy versioning via `POST /policies` (new version, never mutated). Also
  need to add the FK from `agents.default_policy_set_id` to `policies(id)` once that table exists.
  Milestone: change a policy via API, see the running interceptor's behavior change within ~1s, no
  restart.

## Known deviations from BUILD_PLAN.md
- None in phase *order*. Two implementation-level deviations from the original spec docs, both
  flagged in code/API_SPEC.md/ARCHITECTURE.md rather than silently guessed: (1) interceptor language
  (Phase 0, §7), (2) interceptor doesn't proxy the real downstream call, the SDK does (Phase 1, §8).

## Open questions / decisions needed
- None currently blocking. One thing to revisit in Phase 5: `POST /agents` (dashboard API, needs RBAC)
  doesn't exist yet — Phase 1's tests insert agents directly via SQL as a stand-in. Confirm this
  registration flow gets built in Phase 5 alongside the rest of the dashboard API, not deferred further.
